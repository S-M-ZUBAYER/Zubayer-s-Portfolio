            <h3>My First Book of Chinese Calligraph</h3>
            <p>My First Book of Chinese Calligraphy is a fun and engaging introduction to one of China's most celebrated
                arts and crafts for kids. Calligraphy--the art of producing decorative handwriting or lettering with a
                pen or brush--has been around for thousands of years. In this fun calligraphy-for-kids book, readers
                will follow along with Mimi, an eigh- year-old, who takes her first steps towards learning this magical
                art.
